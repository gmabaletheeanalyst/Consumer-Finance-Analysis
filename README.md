### Credit Score Analysis

The portfolio demonstrates a healthy credit distribution skewed toward prime borrowers:

| Credit Score Band | Customer Count | Risk Level | Percentage |
|---|---|---|---|
| **700-850 (Excellent)** | 137,000 | Low | 50.7% |
| **650-699 (Good)** | 76,000 | Low-Medium | 28.1% |
| **600-649 (Fair)** | 39,000 | Medium | 14.4% |
| **550-599 (Poor)** | 13,000 | High | 4.8% |
| **300-549 (Very Poor)** | 5,000 | Very High | 1.85% |

**Portfolio Strength:** 78.8% of customers carry credit scores of 650 or above, indicating prime-to-near-prime lending focus. However, the 19% subprime segment (scores <650) warrants elevated risk management.

### Employment Stability Insights

- **10+ years tenure:** 89,000 customers (33%) - Most stable, lowest default risk
- **<1 year tenure:** 25,000 customers (9.3%) - High turnover risk segment
- **1-3 years tenure:** 62,000 customers (23%) - Moderate stability
- **Blank/Unknown:** 94,000 customers (35%) - Data quality gap requiring remediation

**Key Finding:** Customers with 10+ years employment tenure show 30-40% lower default rates than those with <1 year tenure. Employment stability screening should be emphasized in underwriting.

### Home Ownership Impact

The portfolio shows meaningful segmentation by home ownership status:

- **Mortgage Holders:** Largest segment, representing borrowers with established housing stability
- **Renters:** Represents mobility and potential income instability
- **Homeowners (Own):** Typically demonstrate superior repayment discipline

**Insight:** Home ownership status correlates with 2-3% lower default rates. Consider enhanced pricing or terms for renters to compensate for elevated risk.

### Loan Purpose Analysis

**Highest Default Rates (Risk Concentration):**
1. **Debt Consolidation:** 7.05% default rate - *$532.2M disbursed* ⚠️
   - Largest loan purpose category; consolidation borrowers show mixed credit behavior
   - Recommendation: Tighter underwriting on debt-to-income ratios
   
2. **Wedding Expenses:** 6.49% default rate
3. **Small Business:** 6.09% default rate - High volatility and income unpredictability
4. **Renewable Energy:** 5.85% default rate

**Lowest Default Rates (Strongest Performers):**
- **Car Loans:** 1.06% default rate - Secured asset provides collateral protection
- **Credit Cards:** 1.12% default rate - Revolving credit typically attracts creditworthy borrowers
- **Debt Consolidation (alternative structure):** 1.57% default rate

**Portfolio Composition:**
- **Debt Consolidation:** 152,338 loans (56.4% of portfolio)
- **Credit Card:** 64,477 loans (23.9%)
- **Home Improvement:** 17,601 loans (6.5%)
- **Other:** 16,279 loans (6.0%)
- **Major Purchase:** 5,584 loans (2.1%)
- **Medical:** 3,173 loans (1.2%)

**Strategic Insight:** Debt consolidation dominates the portfolio (56%) but carries elevated default risk (7.05%). Implementing stricter qualification criteria or risk-based pricing could significantly reduce losses.

### Loan Term Performance

**60-Month Terms:**
- Count: 190,000 loans (70.21%)
- Average Interest Rate: 13.08%
- Approval Rate: 91.31%
- Fully Paid Rate: 62.45%
- Delinquency Rate: 40.57%

**36-Month Terms:**
- Count: 80,000 loans (29.79%)
- Lower delinquency rate (59.43% delinquent)
- Higher completion rates

**Finding:** Shorter loan terms (36 months) demonstrate significantly better performance metrics with lower delinquency rates, though lower disbursement volumes suggest market preference for longer terms.

### Loan Grade Distribution

Default rates increase substantially across lower credit grades:

| Grade | Disbursed | Default Rate | Volume |
|---|---|---|---|
| **B** | $1.17B | Baseline | Largest segment |
| **C** | $1.16B | Elevated | Standard risk |
| **A** | $0.89B | Lower | Prime borrowers |
| **D** | $0.61B | High | Subprime |
| **E** | $0.23B | Higher | Deep subprime |
| **F** | $0.08B | Elevated | High-risk segment |
| **G** | $0.02B | Maximum | Rare, highest risk |

**Portfolio Balance:** While the portfolio is heavily concentrated in B/C grades (45% of disbursements), this reflects the consumer lending market norm. Grade A loans should be expanded where possible.

- **South:** 6.61% default rate (on-par)
- **West:** Slightly lower default rate
- **Northeast:** *Top risk region* - Highest default concentration

**Key Finding:** The Northeast emerges as the riskiest region with disproportionate defaults. Investigate root causes: employment volatility, higher cost-of-living stress, or underwriting gaps.

### Top 5 Risk States

| State | Approval Rate | Default Rate | Avg Loan Size | Risk Profile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AZ** | 91.64% | 6.51% | $16,265 | Moderate risk |

## Loan Repayment Trends

<img width="925" height="514" alt="1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34657425-2e39-4cee-890f-ee3085ac6b81" />



### Delinquency & Default Trajectory

The multi-year trend analysis reveals concerning patterns:

**2012-2015 Period:**
- Delinquency rates rose from ~25% to ~45% (peak)
- Default rates relatively stable at 6-6.5%
- Reflects economic conditions and portfolio aging

**2016-2019 Period:**
- Delinquency rates declined from 45% to ~30%
- Default rates increased from 5.5% to 6.61%
- Indicates shift from delinquency to charge-offs for non-recovering accounts

**Interpretation:** The inverse relationship between delinquency and default suggests maturing collection processes. Aged delinquencies are ultimately being charged off rather than recovered.

### Term-Based Repayment Performance

**60-Month Terms (Longer Duration):**
- Delinquency Rate: 40.57%
- Fully Paid Rate: 37.55%
- Ongoing Default Risk: Higher through extended term

**36-Month Terms (Shorter Duration):**
- Delinquency Rate: 59.43%
- Fully Paid Rate: 62.45%
- Earlier resolution indicates better borrower quality self-selection

**NPL Ratio:** 8.29% - Elevated above industry benchmarks of 4-6%
- Current NPL borrowers: 22,437 customers
- NPL principal at risk: ~$345M

### Net Loan Revenue Trends

Net loan revenue demonstrates recovery trajectory post-2016:
- 2016 represented trough: High defaults offsetting revenue gains
- 2017-2019: Revenue stabilization as portfolio quality improved and collection effectiveness increased
- Projected 2019 revenue: $410M+ (annualized basis)

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (0-3 Months)

**1. High-Risk Segment Intervention ($539M at risk)**
- Establish dedicated collections unit for 36,000 high-risk customers
- Implement early warning systems using payment date tracking and behavioral signals
- Offer proactive hardship programs before delinquency occurs
- **Expected Impact:** Reduce 13.29% high-risk default rate by 20-30%, recovering $32-48M

**2. Northeast Regional Audit**
- Investigate 55,000 loans in Northeast region for underwriting process breakdowns
- Analyze approval standards vs. other regions; tighten if justified
- Review pricing adequacy relative to regional default rates
- **Target:** Bring Northeast default rate to company average (6.61%)

**3. Debt Consolidation Portfolio Review**
- 152,338 loans (56% of portfolio) with 7.05% default rate represents $10.7M annual losses
- Implement enhanced debt-to-income ratio verification for debt consolidation applicants
- Consider risk-based pricing increase of 50-100 basis points
- **Impact:** Reducing DCL default rate from 7.05% to 6.20% saves $13M annually

### Short-Term Initiatives (3-6 Months)

**4. Credit Grade Migration Strategy**
- Expand Grade A and B loan approvals (currently 45% of portfolio)
- Implement automated prescreening to increase prime borrower flow
- Grade C/D/E/F/G represents 55% of portfolio with elevated risk profile
- **Target:** Shift 5-10% of originations from subprime (D-G) to prime (A-B) grades

**5. Employment Verification Enhancement**
- 35% of portfolio has missing/blank employment tenure data
- Implement mandatory employment verification in underwriting
- Develop employment stability scoring model
- Borrowers with 10+ employment tenure show 30-40% lower defaults
- **Impact:** Improved data quality enables better risk segmentation

**6. Loan Term Optimization**
- 36-month terms show 2-3% lower delinquency vs. 60-month terms
- Shift marketing emphasis toward 36-month products for high-risk segments
- Offer pricing incentives (50-75 bps discount) for shorter-term commitments
- **Projection:** Reduce portfolio-wide delinquency from 2.1% to 1.5%

### Long-Term Strategic Initiatives (6-12 Months)

**7. Diversification Beyond Debt Consolidation**
- Currently 56% of portfolio is debt consolidation (7.05% default rate)
- Expand auto lending (1.06% default rate), credit cards (1.12% default rate)
- Reallocate 10-15% of capital toward lower-default loan purposes
- **Revenue Impact:** Slightly lower yields but dramatically improved loss mitigation

**8. Secured Lending Expansion**
- Car-backed loans (1.06% default) and mortgage products significantly outperform unsecured lending
- Develop secured personal loan products using home equity or auto collateral
- Partner with dealers and real estate platforms for origination channels

**9. Predictive Analytics & Early Warning System**
- Develop machine learning model incorporating: credit score trajectory, payment velocity, behavioral patterns
- Implement real-time scoring for early delinquency prediction (30-60 days before missed payment)
- Enable targeted intervention campaigns with 2-3x higher recovery rates vs. reactive collections

**10. Risk-Based Pricing Refinement**
- Current pricing not fully reflecting risk differentiation
- Implement granular pricing model incorporating: credit grade, employment tenure, loan purpose, geography, term
- High-risk segments (poor credit + short tenure + consolidation + Northeast) should carry 200-300 bps premium
- **Financial Impact:** 50-75 bps improvement in risk-adjusted spreads = $20-30M additional annual income

## Key Risk Factors

### Portfolio Concentration Risks

| Risk Factor | Severity | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Debt Consolidation Concentration** | HIGH | 56% portfolio, 7.05% default rate |
| **Subprime Exposure (Grade D-G)** | MEDIUM | 10% of portfolio, elevated defaults |
| **Geographic Concentration** | MEDIUM | 25% of portfolio in South region |
| **High-Risk Customer Segment** | MEDIUM | 13.29% of customers, 30-40% higher default |
| **Employment Data Gaps** | MEDIUM | 35% missing employment tenure data |
| **Northeast Region Risk** | MEDIUM | Highest regional default rate |

### Macroeconomic Sensitivities

- **Employment:** Portfolio default rates spike 100-150 bps during recessionary periods
- **Interest Rates:** Higher rates stress borrower cash flows, particularly consolidation borrowers
- **Consumer Sentiment:** Deteriorating confidence correlates with delinquency uptick

## Conclusion

Goldman Sachs Consumer Finance operates a substantial ($4B) and mature lending portfolio serving 270,000 customers with generally sound underwriting (91.31% approval rate, 78.8% prime-plus credit scores). However, specific risk concentrations demand strategic attention:

The **6.61% default rate and 13.29% high-risk customer concentration** represent both material risk to financial performance and significant opportunity for risk mitigation. Immediate focus should target the underperforming debt consolidation segment (56% of portfolio, 7.05% defaults), high-risk Northeast region, and high-risk customer cohort.

Implementation of recommended interventions—particularly enhanced collections for high-risk segments, debt consolidation portfolio discipline, and geographic risk management—can realistically generate $30-50M in incremental value through loss reduction while maintaining revenue growth trajectory.
